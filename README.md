# ApkTrack

ApkTrack is a simple Android application which periodically checks if your installed apps can be updated.

It was created for users who don't use the Google Play Store, but still need to know when new APKs are available for their apps. ApkTrack performs simple website scraping to grab the latest versions of packages present on the device.

## Usage

![ApkTrack screenshot](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/352620screenshot.png)

* Click on an application to perform a manual version check.
* The buttons at the top are used to respectively search the application list and perform a version check for all applications.
* The last button displays additional options, such as sorting. The settings are in there as well.
* Apps marked in red are outdated. Click the magnifying glass icon to search for the latest APK with your favorite search engine. 

That's it!

## Things to keep in mind

* Applications are *not* updated automatically. ApkTrack may provide a direct link to the latest APK when available, but in the general case, users are expected to find the APK themselves. 
* ApkTrack uses regular expressions to scrape webpages, so it may cease to work without notice if the target websites are modified.
* Although there is a background service checking for updates every day, it may get killed by the OS. Remember to check for updates manually in the application from time to time.

### Build ApkTrack
ApkTrack's build system has been switched to Gradle in order to make it easier for contributors to compile the project. Use the following commands to generate the APK:

```
git clone https://github.com/JusticeRage/ApkTrack.git
cd ApkTrack
gradle build
ls -l ./build/outputs/apk/
```

You may need to [install gradle](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/) first, and set up the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.
