0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------0

2.1.0:
------

  * APK Downloads
    - The OS' download service is now used directly instead of proxying
      requests through the installed browser.
    - Downloads respect the user's preference regarding which networks are
      OK to use (WiFi / mobile data).
    - Downloaded APKs can be installed directly from ApkTrack's UI.
  * Permissions
    - ApkTrack needs a new permission (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) to write
      downloaded APKs to the sdcard.
  * UI
    - Fixed a longstanding issue where the last check date could overlap
      the action icon (that one really bugged me).
  * Settings
    - Added options to ignore all system / Xposed apps in a single click.
      A screen dedicated to managing ignored apps is still warranted.
    - Added a preference allowing users who enabled background checks to
      automatically download new APKs when they become available.
  * Update Sources
    - Merged the 9Folders update source (only used for com.ninefolders.hd3)
      into the AppBrain proxy, because of new anti-scraping countermeasures.

2.0.4:
------

  * Source detection
    - ApkTrack will set the right update source for itself (upstream or
      F-Droid) depending on who signed the APK.
    - The source for all Xposed modules is now detected automatically.
    - The F-Droid app is now correctly handled by the F-Droid source.
  * Miscellaneous
    - Moved the ApkTrack APKs to a server with more bandwidth.
    - Version checks for ApkTrack now take place over HTTPS.
    - Updated German translation.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed  a widespread crash triggered during the initialization
      of the app.
    - Fixed a problem with icon resizing for devices with uncommon DPI.
    - Minor bugfixes for crashes reported through ACRA.

2.0.3:
------

  * Security
    - Communications with the AppBrain proxy and crash report service now take
      place over HTTPS.
    - Certificates used by those websites are bundled with ApkTrack to prevent
      man in the middle attacks.
  * Translations
    - Updated Polish translation.
    - Added Italian translation.
  * Bugfixes
    - Resolved a race condition potentially leading to random crashes.
    - The AppBrain update source returned a malformed result when it doesn't
      have version information for particular apps (i.e. org.eff.actioncenter).
      This is now handled gracefully so other update sources can be tried.
    - Fixed the "currently updating" icon getting hidden because of screen
      rotations.

2.0.2:
------

  * Automated crash reports
    - ACRA has been integrated to the app in order to submit stacktraces when
      ApkTrack crashes (no data is sent without user consent).
    - New settings were created to control whether bug reports should be sent.
    - A privacy policy was written to describe how bug data and user data is
      handled in general.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 2.0.1 triggered when trying to resize
      non-square icons.
    - Fixed a bug causing a crash with VectorDrawables for devices without
      Lollipop.
    - Fixed a bug where trying to determine the network type (WiFi / data) would
      cause a crash.

2.0.1:
------

  * Miscellaneous bugfixes
    - Oversized icons no longer break the UI.
    - Download URLs for Xposed apps are now obtained correctly.
    - App uninstallations now also delete stored icons in the database.

2.0.0:
------

 * Ignoring irrelevant apps
    - When detecting apps present on the device, disabled apps are ignored by
      default.
    - Apps can be swiped to indicate that they should stop being displayed in
      the UI and be ignored in subsequent update checks.
    - An option was added in the settings to reset ignored apps.

 * Detecting installed apps
    - The full app detection is only done once, during the first launch. All
      subsequent updates (packages added and/or removed from the system) are
      now detected through Intents sent by the system.
    - ApkTrack and its background services now communicate with the help of an
      Event Bus, which allows complex information to be passed reliably. Model
      modifications trigger notifications on this event bus, which tell the
      applist which information should be refreshed. Thanks to this, there are
      no more loadings when the model is updated.
    - It shouldn't be possible for ApkTrack to miss apps that are installed,
      removed or updated with this new design. So I'm removing the "Redetect
      installed apps" button which wasn't very elegant nor user-friendly.

 * Database overhaul
    - ApkTrack now uses Sugar ORM to perform its database operations (branch
      1.x contained a lot of manual SQL queries). The codebase is much cleaner
      and easier to maintain now.
    - Icons have been moved to a separate table, which allows ApkTrack to read
      all the application info without eating up the device's RAM. From now on,
      Icons are only loaded when they need to be displayed.

 * Update sources
    - ApkTrack can guess the default update source for some predetermined apps
      based on their digital signature or their package name.
    - The structure of sources.json has been changed. It is more complex now,
      but it allows contributors to specify per-package regular expressions in
      case the information for multiple apps is hosted on a single webpage.
      Formerly, it would have been necessary to create an update source per
      package in some cases.
    - It is also possible to specify a regular expression to locate an APK
      download link on the page. This will allow more direct downloads to be
      provided.
    - F-Droid, Mirakel, Xposed Stable / Beta now all provide direct APK
      downloads.

 * Misc
    - Build system switched to Gradle to make third-party builds easier.
    - ApkTrack will now remember across reboots whether you want to display
      system apps or not.
    - Searches are more flexible, and any part of the name or package name
      can now be matched (not just the beginning as it was the case).
    - Apps with vector icons are now displayed correctly on devices with an API
      level >= 21.
    - Manual changes to the update source are immediately reflected in the UI.
    - The spinning icon which indicates that an app is currently being checked
      isn't lost anymore when the app list is refreshed, sorted or updated.
    - Notifications will not be displayed more than once for each updated app
      (ApkTrack 1.1 would keep display notifications until the app was
      upgraded).

Known issues:
-------------

  * Swiping the app at position N, then scrolling down and up causes a blank
    line to be displayed at position N-1.
  * ApkTrack's APKs are still distributed over HTTP because the server uses a
    self-signed certificate.
  * If Greenify puts ApkTrack into hibernation, app installations, deletions
    and upgrades will be missed. At the moment, the issue may be circumvented
    by waking ApkTrack and performing the installation again, or deleting
    ApkTrack's data to force a full re-detection.
